### Platform Overview

Bytespace empowers you to create reliable, scalable web agents capable of automating tasks on any websiteâ€”whether or not it has an API. Here's an overview of the platform and how it works.

### How Our Automations Work

Most automation tools rely on APIs, but Bytespace uses web-agents to unlock the full potential of web automation. There are two types of automation, but one clear winner:

- **APIs**: Communicate directly with a website's backend code but are limited to less than 1% of websites and only offer what the website owner allows.
- **Web-Agents**: Interact with the website's frontend visual interface, mimicking real user actions like clicking, scrolling, and entering data, making any website automatable.

By using web-agents, Bytespace makes automation accessible for all websites, whether they have APIs or not. If you can do it in a browser, you can automate it with Bytespace.

### **Web-Agent Builder & Chrome Extension**

Our builder and chrome extension use a combination of AI, XPath, and CSS selectors to identify elements on a web page. You can choose these selectors manually, or let our AI do the work for you. 

- **XPath:** A language used to navigate a webpage's structure by defining a precise path to elements, such as "Select the third item in the second list."
- **CSS Selector:** A method to select elements on a webpage based on their styles, attributes, or tags, like "Find the red button or the heading with bold text."
- **AI Selection & Enhancement:** AI interprets natural language prompts to accurately identify and select the right elements on a webpage, combining XPath and CSS to choose the most reliable selectors.

<div style={{ 
  position: 'relative',
  width: '100%',
  aspectRatio: '2/1',
  margin: '20px 0'
}}>
  <div style={{
    position: 'absolute',
    left: 0,
    top: 0,
    width: '49.5%',
    height: '100%',
    background: '#BE48E6',
    borderRadius: '8px',
    display: 'flex',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center'
  }}>
    <span style={{ color: 'white', fontSize: '24px' }}>Builder Interface</span>
  </div>
  <div style={{
    position: 'absolute',
    left: '50.5%',
    top: 0,
    width: '49.5%',
    height: '100%',
    background: '#BE48E6',
    borderRadius: '8px',
    display: 'flex',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center'
  }}>
    <span style={{ color: 'white', fontSize: '24px' }}>Chrome Extension</span>
  </div>
</div>

### **Full Production Infrastructure (Coming Soon)**

Our production infrastructure lets you deploy automations to run on virtual browsers in the background, keeping your personal computer free while workflows operate on autopilot. This will allow you to:

- **Schedule Automations**: Set specific times or recurring intervals for your agents to run, ensuring tasks are completed exactly when needed.
- **Trigger Automations Based on Conditions**: Configure triggers and conditions that activate your agents automatically, like a change on a website or receiving new data.
- **Integrate with Other Apps**: Connect your agents to external platforms, APIs, or workflows to create seamless, end-to-end automation solutions.

Once deployed to the cloud, your automations will stay logged in, bypass captchas and bot detection, and adapt automatically to interface changes on your favorite websites.
