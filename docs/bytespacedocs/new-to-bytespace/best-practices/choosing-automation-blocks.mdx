### Understanding Block Types

Each automation block serves a specific purpose in your workflow. Choosing the right block can make your automation more reliable and efficient.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Action Blocks">
    Basic interactions with web elements:
    - **Click**: For buttons, links, and interactive elements
    - **Type**: For form inputs and text areas
    - **Select**: For dropdowns and multi-select elements
    - **Scroll**: For navigating long pages
    
    <Note>
    Always use the most specific action block for your need. For example, use "Select" for dropdowns instead of "Click" for better reliability.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Wait Blocks">
    Strategic pauses to handle timing:
    - **Wait for Element**: Pause until a specific element appears
    - **Wait for Navigation**: Pause until page load completes
    - **Fixed Delay**: Add specific time delays
    
    <Warning>
    Avoid using fixed delays unless absolutely necessary. Prefer waiting for specific elements or events instead.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Logic Blocks">
    Control flow and decision making:
    - **If/Else**: Conditional branching
    - **Loop**: Repeat actions
    - **Break**: Exit loops early
    - **Try/Catch**: Handle potential errors
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Timing and Delays

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Smart Waiting" icon="clock">
    **Best Practice:**
    - Wait for specific elements
    - Use dynamic timeouts
    - Consider network conditions
    
    **Avoid:**
    - Fixed delays
    - Arbitrary wait times
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Human-Like Pacing" icon="user-clock">
    **Add natural delays between:**
    - Typing characters
    - Clicking elements
    - Page navigation
    
    This helps avoid detection and improves reliability.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Block Selection Strategy

<Steps>
  1. **Start Simple**
     Begin with basic blocks and add complexity only when needed.
  
  2. **Consider Reliability**
     Choose blocks that handle dynamic content and loading times automatically.
  
  3. **Plan for Errors**
     Add error handling for potential issues:
     - Elements not found
     - Network timeouts
     - Invalid states
  
  4. **Optimize Performance**
     Balance reliability with execution speed:
     - Remove unnecessary waits
     - Combine similar actions
     - Use efficient selectors
</Steps>

### Common Patterns

<Accordion title="Form Filling">
```javascript
// Good Pattern
Wait for Form Element
Type Information
Wait for Submit Button
Click Submit
Wait for Success Message

// Avoid
Fixed Delay
Type Information
Fixed Delay
Click Submit
Fixed Delay
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Data Extraction">
```javascript
// Good Pattern
Wait for Container
Loop Through Items
  Try
    Extract Data
    Store Result
  Catch
    Log Error
    Continue
Next Item

// Avoid
Fixed Delay
Extract All Data at Once
```
</Accordion>

### Best Practices by Scenario

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Login Flows" icon="right-to-bracket">
    1. Wait for form visibility
    2. Type credentials naturally
    3. Handle 2FA if needed
    4. Verify successful login
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Data Collection" icon="database">
    1. Use pagination blocks
    2. Implement rate limiting
    3. Handle empty states
    4. Store data incrementally
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Dynamic Content" icon="bolt">
    1. Wait for content load
    2. Verify element state
    3. Use conditional logic
    4. Handle timeouts gracefully
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Error Recovery" icon="shield">
    1. Implement retry logic
    2. Log failures
    3. Use alternative paths
    4. Maintain state
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Advanced Tips

<Note>
**Performance Optimization:**
- Group similar actions
- Minimize page loads
- Use efficient selectors
- Cache repeated data
</Note>

<Warning>
**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Overusing fixed delays
- Neglecting error handling
- Hardcoding values
- Ignoring state management
</Warning>

### Testing Your Blocks

Always test your automation blocks:
1. With different input data
2. Under various network conditions
3. Across different times of day
4. With error scenarios

<Note>
Remember: The most reliable automation is one that can handle unexpected situations gracefully. Take time to implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms.
