title: "Delay"
description: "Add timed delays to your automation workflow. Use this action to wait for elements to load, ensure actions complete, or simulate human-like interaction timing."
---

## Overview

The Delay block pauses the automation for a specified duration. This is particularly useful when:
- Waiting for page elements to load
- Ensuring animations complete
- Simulating human-like interaction timing
- Managing rate-limited operations

## Configuration

<Card>
  This block requires:
  - Delay duration in milliseconds
  - Example: `2000` for 2 seconds
  - Minimum: `100ms`
  - Maximum: `30000ms` (30 seconds)
</Card>

## Usage Example

<Card title="Scenario: Waiting for content to load">
  ### Common Use Cases:
  - After page navigation: `2000ms`
  - After button clicks: `500ms`
  - Before form submission: `1000ms`
  - Between API calls: `3000ms`
</Card>

## Notes
<Warning>
  - Use delays sparinglyâ€”they make automation slower
  - Consider using Wait For Element instead for dynamic content
  - Shorter delays (100-500ms) work well for most UI interactions
  - Longer delays might be needed for heavy page loads or rate limiting
