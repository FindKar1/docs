description: "Fire browser and custom events on webpage elements. Use this action to simulate user interactions, trigger JavaScript listeners, and interact with dynamic UI components."
---

## Inputs

### ☐ Prompt / Description *(Required)*
A clear and concise instruction describing what this step should do. This helps the AI debug and re-trigger the event if needed.

<Note type="success">
  **Good Example:** `"Trigger a 'change' event on the dropdown menu to apply the selected option."`
</Note>

<Note type="danger">
  **Bad Example:** `"Make sure the dropdown works by doing whatever is needed to activate it."`
  
  **Why it's bad?** Too vague, lacks specificity about the event and the target element.
</Note>

### ☐ Element Selector *(Required)*
Define the element where the event should be triggered using one of the following methods:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="CSS Selector">
    Use standard CSS selectors to identify the element.
  </Card>
  <Card title="XPath">
    Use an XPath expression to precisely locate the element.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### ☐ Event Type *(Required)*
<Card>
  Choose from standard browser events:
  - Mouse Events: `click`, `dblclick`, `mousedown`, `mouseup`, `mouseenter`, `mouseleave`
  - Form Events: `focus`, `blur`, `change`, `input`, `submit`
  - Keyboard Events: `keydown`, `keyup`
  - Custom Events: Supported by the webpage
</Card>

## Usage Example

<Card title="Scenario: Simulating a dropdown selection change">
  ### ✅ Good Prompt:
  *"Trigger a 'change' event on the dropdown menu to apply the selected option."*

  ### ✅ Good Element Selectors:
  <Card>
    CSS Selector: `select#country-dropdown`
  </Card>

  <Card>
    XPath: `//select[@id='country-dropdown']`
  </Card>

  ### ✅ Event Configuration:
  - **Event Type:** `change`
</Card>

## Notes
<Warning>
  - The **Prompt / Description** is required to help AI debug and adjust the event trigger if needed.
  - Ensure the selected event matches the expected behavior of the element (e.g., use `change` for dropdowns, `click` for buttons).
  - Some events might require additional scripting if the website relies on JavaScript listeners that do not respond to synthetic events.
