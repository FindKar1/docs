title: "JavaScript Code"
description: "Execute custom JavaScript code in your automation. Use this action to run advanced scripts, modify elements, interact with APIs, and perform operations not covered by standard automation blocks."
---

## Inputs

### ☐ Prompt / Description *(Required)*
A clear and concise instruction describing what this step should do. This helps the AI debug the automation if website changes impact execution.

<Note type="success">
  **Good Example:** `"Run a script to log 'Hello world!' in the console and proceed to the next block."`
</Note>

<Note type="danger">
  **Bad Example:** `"Execute some JavaScript that does something useful on the page."`
  
  **Why it's bad?** Too vague, lacks specificity about the intended script execution.
</Note>

### ☐ JavaScript Code Editor *(Required)*
<Card>
  Write the JavaScript code to be executed within the webpage.
  Ensure that the script ends with `bytespaceNextBlock()` to continue execution.
</Card>

## Usage Example

<Card title="Scenario: Logging a message and clicking a button">
  ### ✅ Good Prompt:
  *"Run a script to log 'Hello world!' in the console and click the 'Submit' button."*

  ### ✅ Good JavaScript Code:
  ```javascript
  console.log("Hello world!");
  document.querySelector("button.submit").click();
  bytespaceNextBlock();
  ```
</Card>

## Notes
<Warning>
  - The **Prompt / Description** is required to help AI debug and re-adjust the script if needed.
  - The script should **always end with `bytespaceNextBlock()`** to ensure workflow execution continues.
  - Ensure the JavaScript is compatible with the webpage environment and doesn't cause unexpected behavior.
</Warning>
