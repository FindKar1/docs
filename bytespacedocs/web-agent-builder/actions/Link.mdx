title: "Link"
description: "Interact with hyperlinks on a webpage. Use this action to navigate to new pages, open external links, or trigger JavaScript-based navigation."
---

## Inputs

### ☐ Prompt / Description *(Required)*
A clear and concise instruction that describes what this step should do. This helps the AI debug and re-find the element if the webpage structure changes.

<Note type="success">
  **Good Example:** `"Click the 'Learn More' link to navigate to the details page."`
</Note>

<Note type="danger">
  **Bad Example:** `"Find and click some kind of link that takes you somewhere useful."`
  
  **Why it's bad?** Too vague, doesn't specify which link to interact with.
</Note>

### ☐ Element Selector *(Required)*
Define the hyperlink element to be clicked using one of the following methods:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="CSS Selector">
    Use standard CSS selectors to identify the element.
  </Card>
  <Card title="XPath">
    Use an XPath expression to precisely locate the element.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Usage Example

<Card title="Scenario: Clicking a 'Learn More' link">
  ### ✅ Good Prompt:
  *"Click the 'Learn More' link to navigate to the details page."*

  ### ✅ Good Element Selectors:
  <Card>
    CSS Selector: `a.learn-more`
  </Card>

  <Card>
    XPath: `//a[text()='Learn More']`
  </Card>
</Card>

## Notes
<Warning>
  - The **Prompt / Description** is required to help AI debug and adjust the selector if needed.
  - Ensure the selector uniquely identifies the link to avoid unintended navigation.
  - Some links trigger JavaScript events instead of direct navigation—ensure the action works as expected before deploying.
</Warning>
