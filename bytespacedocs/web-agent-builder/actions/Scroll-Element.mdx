---

## Inputs

### ☐ Prompt / Description *(Required)*
A clear and concise instruction describing what this step should do. This helps the AI debug and re-adjust the scrolling behavior if needed.

<Note type="success">
  **Good Example:** `"Scroll down 500 pixels to load more search results."`
</Note>

<Note type="danger">
  **Bad Example:** `"Move the page down a bit so that more things appear, but make sure it's not too much scrolling."`
  
  **Why it's bad?** Too vague, doesn't specify how much to scroll, and lacks a clear purpose.
</Note>

### ☐ Element Selector *(Required)*
Define the element to be scrolled using one of the following methods:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="CSS Selector">
    Use standard CSS selectors to identify the element.
    Default: `"html"` (scrolls the entire page)
  </Card>
  <Card title="XPath">
    Use an XPath expression to precisely locate the element.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### ☐ Scroll Behavior *(Required)*
<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Horizontal Scroll">
    Specify how many pixels to scroll left/right
    *(Optional, Default: 0)*
  </Card>
  <Card title="Vertical Scroll">
    Specify how many pixels to scroll up/down
    *(Optional, Default: 0)*
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scroll to Element">
    If checked, automatically scroll the selected element into view
    *(Optional)*
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Usage Example

<Card title="Scenario: Scrolling down to load more search results">
  ### ✅ Good Prompt:
  *"Scroll down 500 pixels to load more search results."*

  ### ✅ Good Element Selectors:
  <Card>
    CSS Selector: `html` *(for full-page scrolling)*
  </Card>

  <Card>
    XPath: `//div[@class='results-container']` *(to scroll within a specific section)*
  </Card>

  ### ✅ Scroll Behavior:
  - **Vertical Scroll:** `500` pixels
  - **Horizontal Scroll:** `0` pixels
</Card>

## Notes
<Warning>
  - The **Prompt / Description** is required to help AI debug and adjust the scrolling behavior if needed.
  - Ensure the selector uniquely identifies the target element to avoid unintended scrolling.
  - Using "Scroll to Element" is recommended when working with dynamically loaded content that requires an element to be in view before interaction.
