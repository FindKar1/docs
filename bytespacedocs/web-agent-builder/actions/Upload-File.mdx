## Inputs

### ☐ Prompt / Description *(Required)*
A clear and concise instruction describing what this step should do. This helps the AI debug and re-locate the element if needed.

<Note type="success">
  **Good Example:** `"Upload the user's profile picture to the file input field."`
</Note>

<Note type="danger">
  **Bad Example:** `"Make sure a file gets uploaded somewhere in the form."`
  
  **Why it's bad?** Too vague, lacks specificity about which file and which input field to use.
</Note>

### ☐ Element Selector *(Required)*
Define the file input field where the file should be uploaded using one of the following methods:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="CSS Selector">
    Use standard CSS selectors to identify the element.
  </Card>
  <Card title="XPath">
    Use an XPath expression to precisely locate the element.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### ☐ File Reference *(Required)*
<Card>
  The file to be uploaded must be referenced from the workflow:
  - Can be a static file path
  - Can be a dynamic reference based on workflow data
  - Must be accessible by the automation
</Card>

## Usage Example

<Card title="Scenario: Uploading a profile picture">
  ### ✅ Good Prompt:
  *"Upload the user's profile picture to the file input field."*

  ### ✅ Good Element Selectors:
  <Card>
    CSS Selector: `input[type="file"]`
  </Card>

  <Card>
    XPath: `//input[@type='file']`
  </Card>

  ### ✅ File Configuration:
  - **File Reference:** `{{ profile_picture_path }}`
</Card>

## Notes
<Warning>
  - The **Prompt / Description** is required to help AI debug and adjust the file upload if needed.
  - The file input element must be an actual `<input type="file">` element.
  - Some custom upload buttons may require additional event triggering.
  - Ensure the referenced file path is valid and accessible by the automation.
</Warning>
