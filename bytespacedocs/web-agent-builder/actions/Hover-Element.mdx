title: "Hover Element"
description: "Simulate mouse hover interactions on webpage elements. Use this action to trigger tooltips, reveal dropdown menus, and interact with hover-based UI components."
---

## Inputs

### ☐ Prompt / Description *(Required)*
A clear and concise instruction describing what this step should do. This helps the AI debug and re-find the element if needed.

<Note type="success">
  **Good Example:** `"Hover over the profile icon to reveal the dropdown menu."`
</Note>

<Note type="danger">
  **Bad Example:** `"Move the mouse around until something appears."`
  
  **Why it's bad?** Too vague, lacks specificity about which element to hover over.
</Note>

### ☐ Element Selector *(Required)*
Define the element to be hovered over using one of the following methods:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="CSS Selector">
    Use standard CSS selectors to identify the element.
  </Card>
  <Card title="XPath">
    Use an XPath expression to precisely locate the element.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Usage Example

<Card title="Scenario: Revealing a dropdown menu">
  ### ✅ Good Prompt:
  *"Hover over the profile icon to reveal the dropdown menu."*

  ### ✅ Good Element Selectors:
  <Card>
    CSS Selector: `.profile-icon`
  </Card>

  <Card>
    XPath: `//div[@class='profile-icon']`
  </Card>
</Card>

## Notes
<Warning>
  - The **Prompt / Description** is required to help AI debug and adjust the hover action if needed.
  - Ensure the selector uniquely identifies the element to avoid unintended interactions.
  - Some hover effects might require additional time before the UI updates—consider adding a wait time if necessary.
