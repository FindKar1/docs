title: "Get Text"
description: "Extract text from a specific element on a webpage. Use this action to retrieve information such as product prices, article titles, user-generated content, and other on-page text."
---

## Inputs

### ☐ Prompt / Description *(Required)*
A clear and concise instruction that describes what this step should do. This is essential for AI to debug and re-find the element if the webpage structure changes.

<Note type="success">
  **Good Example:** `"Extract the product name from the item detail page."`
</Note>

<Note type="danger">
  **Bad Example:** `"Try to find and get some text that looks like a product name, but make sure it's not too long and is relevant."`
  
  **Why it's bad?** Too vague, overly verbose, and doesn't specify what text to extract.
</Note>

### ☐ Element Selector *(Required)*
Define the element from which text should be extracted using one of the following methods:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="CSS Selector">
    Use standard CSS selectors to identify the element.
  </Card>
  <Card title="XPath">
    Use an XPath expression to precisely locate the element.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Output Options

### ☐ Assign to variable *(Optional)*
Store the extracted text in a variable for later use in the workflow.

### ☐ Insert to table *(Optional)*
Save the extracted text into a structured table for further processing.

## Usage Example

<Card title="Scenario: Extracting a product name from an e-commerce page">
  ### ✅ Good Prompt:
  *"Extract the product name from the item detail page."*

  ### ✅ Good Element Selectors:
  <Card>
    CSS Selector: `h1.product-title`
  </Card>

  <Card>
    XPath: `//h1[@class='product-title']`
  </Card>

  ### ✅ Output Options:
  - **Assign to variable** → `product_name`
  - **Insert to table** → Column: `Product Name`
</Card>

## Notes
<Warning>
  - The **Prompt / Description** is required to help AI debug and adjust the selector if the webpage structure changes.
  - Ensure the selector uniquely identifies the target element to avoid extracting unintended text.
  - If the page content is dynamic, consider using a robust selector or referencing workflow data.
