### Overview

The Element Selector is a powerful tool that helps you identify and target specific elements on any webpage. Whether you're looking to click a button, fill out a form, or extract text, this tool ensures your automation interacts with the right elements every time.

### Basic Selection

<Steps>
  1. **Activate the Selector**
     Click the selector icon in the builder toolbar to start targeting elements.
  
  2. **Hover and Click**
     Move your mouse over the desired element. The selector will highlight elements as you hover.
  
  3. **Verify Selection**
     Once clicked, the element's details will appear in the builder panel.
</Steps>

### Enhance Selector

The Enhance Selector feature helps you create more robust and reliable element selectors that can withstand website updates and dynamic content changes.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Text Based">
    Create selectors that find elements based on their text content:

    - Partial match: "contains(Login)"
    - Regular expressions for complex patterns
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Attribute Based">
    Target elements using their HTML attributes:
    - ID: "#login-button"
    - Class: ".btn-primary"
    - Custom attributes: "[data-testid='submit']"
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Relative Position">
    Select elements based on their relationship to other elements:

### Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Element Not Found">
  If your selector fails to find an element:
  1. Verify the element is visible and not in an iframe
  2. Check if the element is dynamically loaded
  3. Try using the Enhance Selector for a more robust solution
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Multiple Elements Found">
  When your selector matches multiple elements:
  1. Use more specific attributes
