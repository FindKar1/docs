### Running Automations On Your Personal Computer

Launch your agent directly on your desktop to automate tasks instantly. This setup is perfect for quick, single-use workflows or personal projects.

<Warning>
While the automation runs, your computer will be fully dedicated to the task and unavailable for other activities.
