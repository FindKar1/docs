## Build Your Web-Agent on Bytespace

This guide walks you through the steps to build, test, and run your first web agent on Bytespace. You'll also get a glimpse of future features like deploying agents on virtual machines and integrating them with other apps.

---

### 1. Requirements

Before you get started, make sure you:

- [**Create a Bytespace Account**](https://www.bytespace.ai/login)
- [**Install Google Chrome Browser**](https://www.google.com/chrome/)\*: this browser is required in order to run automations.
- **Install Bytespace Chrome Extension**: required in order to operate the builder, create workflows, and run your automations.

<Note>
\* Make sure to have only one Google Chrome browser open while building and testing your automations. Having multiple browsers open can cause issues with selector verification.
</Note>

### 2. Build Your Web-Agent, Step by Step

Start building your web agent using the **Bytespace** **Web-Agent Builder**. Most of you will use a mixture of AI prompting and recording to create the global workflow structure and Manual Editing to refine specific steps. For more complex workflows, we recommend AI Prompting + Manual Editing.

- **Prompting**: Describe what you want your agent to do using natural language. Keep your description to single actions on websites (ex. click Search button)
- **Recording**: Use the Chrome Extension to record your workflow using actions like clicks, scrolls, and data entry.
- **Manual Editing**: Fine-tune workflows by customizing individual automation blocks in the builder. Blocks represent steps in the workflow.

---

### 3. Test Your Web-Agent in the Builder

Run your agent directly in the builder to ensure it works as expected. Debug issues, refine workflows, and verify that all actions execute correctly on the target website. There's a few way to test:

- **Test Entire Workflow**: will run the workflow from start to finish.
- **Test Workflow from a Specific Step**: hovering over an automation block and clicking the "Run" button above it, will run the workflow from that specific point.
- **Test Only a Single Step**/*: once you click into an automation block, you can choose to run only that step from the expanded block view.

<Warning>
**Important:** if testing individual steps, or testing a workflow midway through, have your Google Chrome Browser open to the area of the website where that specific step starts.
</Warning>

### 4. Run Your Web-Agent in Two Ways

- **On Your Personal Computer (Locally)**: Run the agent directly on your machine for quick, one-off workflows. While running locally, your computer will be occupied and unavailable for other tasks.

- **In the Cloud *(Coming Soon)***: Deploy your agent to Bytespace's cloud infrastructure for 24/7 automation. Cloud execution uses virtual machines, residential proxies to bypass geo-restrictions, and tools to handle authentication and captchas seamlessly, freeing up your personal computer.

---

### 5. Connect Web-Agents to Other Apps *(Coming Soon)*

Integrate your web agents with other tools and platforms using the Bytespace API. This feature will allow you to:

- Call agents from platforms like Zapier, Make, or your custom applications.
- Extend workflows by combining Bytespace automation with existing tools.
