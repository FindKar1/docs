Bytespace is a platform that allows you to build and run web-agents. A web-agent is a program that can navigate the web, interact with websites, and perform repetitive tasks automatically ðŸš€.

### What can you do with Bytespace?
- **Automate any website:** If you can do it in a browser, you can automate it with Bytespace.
- **Save time and scale effortlessly:** Free yourself from repetitive tasks and focus on what matters. Empower your team to work like a company ten times their size.
- **Build fast and customize freely:** From simple workflows to multi-step automations, Bytespace lets you build automations in minutes and customize them however you like.

### How do our automations work?
Most automation tools rely on APIs, but Bytespace uses web-agents to unlock the full potential of web automation. There are two types of automation, but one clear winner:

  <Card title="APIs">
    Communicate directly with a website's backend code but are limited to less than 1% of websites and only offer what the website owner allows.

    - Limited availability across websites
    - Restricted by platform limitations
    - Frequent breaking changes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Web-Agents">
    Interact with websites through their visual interface, just like a human user would, making any website automatable.

    - Works with any website
    - No API dependencies
    - Adapts to site changes
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

By using web-agents, Bytespace makes automation accessible for all websites, whether they have APIs or not. If you can do it in a browser, you can automate it with Bytespace.
