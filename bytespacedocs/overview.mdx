### How do our automations work?

Most automation tools rely on APIs, but Bytespace uses web-agents to unlock the full potential of web automation. There are two types of automation, but one clear winner:

- **APIs**: Communicate directly with a website's backend code but are limited to less than 1% of websites and only offer what the website owner allows.
- **Web-Agents**: Interact with the website's frontend visual interface, mimicking real user actions like clicking, scrolling, and entering data, making any website automatable.

By using web-agents, Bytespace makes automation accessible for all websites, whether they have APIs or not. If you can do it in a browser, you can automate it with Bytespace.

### What can you do with Bytespace?

- **Automate any website:** If you can do it in a browser, you can automate it with Bytespace.
- **Save time and scale effortlessly:** Free yourself from repetitive tasks and focus on what matters. Empower your team to work like a company ten times their size.
- **Build fast and customize freely:** from simple workflows to multi-step automations, Bytespace let's you build automations in minutes and customize them however you like.

### **Full Production Infrastructure (Coming Soon)**

Our production infrastructure lets you deploy automations to run on virtual browsers in the background, keeping your personal computer free while workflows operate on autopilot. This will allow you to:

- **Schedule Automations**: Set specific times or recurring intervals for your agents to run, ensuring tasks are completed exactly when needed.
- **Trigger Automations Based on Conditions**: Configure triggers and conditions that activate your agents automatically, like a change on a website or receiving new data.
- **Integrate with Other Apps**: Connect your agents to external platforms, APIs, or workflows to create seamless, end-to-end automation solutions.

Once deployed to the cloud, your automations will stay logged in, bypass captchas and bot detection, and adapt automatically to interface changes on your favorite websites.
